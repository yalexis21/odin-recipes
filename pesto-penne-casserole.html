<h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat an oven to 200c (400f). And cook the pasta according to the package instructions.<br>We suggest cooking the pasta to al dente because the pasta cooks more when bakes.</li>
    <li>In a 13x9 inch baking pan, add the cooked pasta, basil pesto, minced garlic, parmesan,<br>chili flakes, salt and pepper, heavy cream, and the baby spinach, and carefully mix with<br>a wooden spoon until the ingredients are well combined.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the grated mozzarella cheese on top, we like to use it a lot, but you are free to<br>use it as much as you like.</li>
    <li>Bake the pasta in a 200c (400f) preheated oven for 20 minutes or until the cheese is<br>slightly golden brown on top.</li>
    <li>Serve by itself or next to your favorite protein or salad and enjoy!</li></ol>
