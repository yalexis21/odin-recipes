    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 generous teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, preferably Mexican oregano</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup diced green peppers</li>
        <li>1 pound hot dogs, sliced</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes (or 3 1/2 cups tomato sauce or puree)</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 rounded cups elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded white Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>green onions, sliced, for the top (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add olive oil to a large pot and place over high heat. Add beef; cook and stir, breaking up<br> with a spoon or spatula, about 2 minutes. Add onions and salt, and cook, stirring, until beef<br> is crumbly, and onions turn translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, cinnamon, cayenne, dried oregano, and<br> garlic. Cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add peppers, sliced hot dogs, crushed tomatoes, and water. Stir together; bring the mixture<br> to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until cooked to<br> your taste, at least 30 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning.</li>
        <li>Once chili is nearly ready, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.<br> Stir in macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, 1 minute<br> less than specified in package directions, until not quite tender, and still firm to the bite, about<br> 8 to 11 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Turn off heat under chili, drain macaroni, and add to the pot of chili. Stir until combined,<br> and transfer mixture into a large, deep (15x10-inch) baking dish.</li>
        <li>Mix Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses together in a bowl, and transfer about 60% of cheese<br> to top of chili mixture. Use a spoon to thoroughly mix cheese into the casserole.</li>
        <li>Apply remaining cheese evenly over the top, and lightly poke down into the surface with the <br>tip of a spoon.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Let rest 15 minutes before serving,<br> topped with green onions.</li>
    </ol>
